# TryVR
A map for locating users willing to share their Oculus Rift DK1

When the Oculus Rift Dev Kit first started shipping, everyone wanted to try it out, but only a handful of people had it. Those who had kits were often willing to invite others over to their homes to experience the top of the line consumer VR headset. 

This map helped identify where people were, and who was willing to share their Dev Kit.
